This repo includes the corresponding data as well as a Python-Script which is a Random Forest based classifier to predict whether a mushroom is eatable our poisonous.
It can be shown, that a simple Random Forest Model is able to solve this prediction problem with an accuracy of over 0.98.
To compare the model with an model based on a artificial neural network there is a second python script "ANN.py" which solve that problem with a similar good result.
